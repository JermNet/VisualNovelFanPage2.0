		<h1>Ranking Things That Are On My Shelves</h1>
		<p>The title is self-explanatory, this is a ranking of every item on my shelves (and even some things that aren't)! The actual images of the shelves themselves are at the end for spoiler free shelf item ranking. I will give each item 5 statistics. Release Date: Simple, yet important. Value: Monetary value of the item (in CAD since I'm Canadian), I suspect I'll have some trouble finding prices on some of the weirder items, so I intend to play kind of fast and loose with this one (this is all in good fun anyway). Display Factor: A mix of how cool and easy an item is to display from 1 to 10. Personal Ranking: How I feel personally about the item without keeping my emotions limited from 1 to 10. "Objective" Ranking: I will do my best to see things from an objective standpoint and give a given item a ranking from 1 to 10. A few more notes before I start, the button that says "jump to lists" does just that, giving lists of every item, so you can pick up where you left off. It is at the bottom, once again, for spoiler free item viewing. Finally, this is all in order per shelf from top to bottom and left to right. So that's to say, it's in order in no particular order since I just put items where they fit. Either way, time to start the ranking!</p>
		
		<h2>Item #1: Super Mario Bros (1993) VHS Tape</h2>

				<h3>Release Date: 1993-5-28 (Film) 1993 (VHS?)<br/>
				Value: $40-$70</br>
				Display Factor: 8/10<br/>
				Personal Ranking: 8/10<br/>
				Objective Ranking: 4/10</h3>
				<p>We're starting out strong here, aren't we? I've got loads to say about this... thing. First off, the date. There's nothing interesting about the release date of the film itself but oddly enough I found conflicting dates for the actual VHS tape. First off, there was no concrete date, just a year which I suppose makes sense, but the odd parts were that I found the years 1993 and 1994 from different sources. There was no specific region mentioned either for said dates either. It's very possible that I haven't dug deep enough (especially since this isn't meant to be taken to seriously) but I would say that 1993 is much more likely (for North America at least) considering when in the year the film actually released and the fact that the box itself has no mention of the year 1994. In terms of value I did NOT pay that much for a single tape. I got it in a lot of a bunch of tapes and after considering how many were in that lot (at least 300) and how many I kept from it, I'd say that at the very, very most I spent no more than 5 Canadian on this tape, so pretty damn good deal. Any individual tape of a big movie is honestly going to be more than it's worth unless you're getting them at a thrift store, so huge lots are the way to go. Display wise, tapes are a pretty cool thing to put on a shelf, especially for a conversation starter of a film like this. I only dock some points since (as my shelves are wall shelves) there's only two shelves that can hold tapes because of their height for a total of only 10 that can be displayed, your mileage will vary of course. I have a certain affinity for this film. Not only that, but I was only born in 2005, so I didn't watch it in theaters or anything like that, but I was first exposed to this film when I was around 12 or so through the internet and I remember enjoying it quite a bit, actually. Nowadays, I enjoy it in more of a fun bad type of way, but there are certain aspects I can appreciate now that I couldn't before, especially the set design. But, I think I've rambled on too much for just one item so onto the next!</p>

		<h2>Item #2: Wayne's World VHS Tape</h2>
		<section class="wrapper-2">
		
			<div class="text-box-2">
			
				<img class="round" src="images/waynesworld.jpg" alt="Image of Wayne's World on VHS.">
				<h3>Release Date: 2-14-1992 (Film) 8-12-1982, 12-25-1993 and 2001 (VHS)<br/>
				Value: $3-$10<br/>
				Display Factor: 7.5/10<br/>
				Personal Ranking: 9/10<br/>
				Objective Ranking: 6/10</h3>
				<p>Another tape! In fact, the next three after this are also tapes so be prepared for some more semi, not really, kinda sorta, movie reviews. I'll start in reverse order this time since my objective ranking might stand out a little bit. To be honest, it's only so low because it's a VHS tape. Sure, it's a great movie, but that means most people will it to look great as well. It's complete understandable, don't get me wrong I'm not exempt here, but I still enjoy watching VHS tapes and this is how I first watched this movie in particular, so I think it means more to me than most. I also docked a half a point in the Display Factor category since this is a bit less of a talking piece. Price wise, I was pleasantly surprised. I was almost certain that this would be unreasonably expensive (though, not as much as the Super Mario Bros movie) due to it being a popular film and all but no, only the sealed copies got really up there in price as you might expect. Another thing that surprised me is that there are 5 versions of this tape! The only differences are the adverts before the movie and the legal jargon but still, neat nonetheless. Although I didn't check the tape itself (I couldn't be bothered to plug in the VCR to be honest) the box says 1993 of which there is only one version from that year. Still, of the three from 1992 there are two United States versions and then a specific Canadian version, so I guess it's possible I have that version with a misprint or something (though, that's unlikely as the 1993 version doesn't have an AIDS P.S.A. and I don't remember ever seeing it). Either way, this is a great movie with some strange humor and footage from the Sonic 1 prototype of all things.</p>
